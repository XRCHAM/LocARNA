[>DESCRIPTION]

Folds RNA sequences by calling the Vienna RNA library and directly writes
LocARNA's pp 2.0 format.
In many cases this program can replace a call to RNAfold or RNAalifold followed by
a conversion of its output to pp format. mlocarna uses this script wherever
possible. This tool allows moreover precomputing "in-loop" probabilities as
used by SPARSE and ExpaRNA-p.
