[>DESCRIPTION]

sparse is an even faster, stronger sparsified pairwise alignment
algorithm than locarna. Like locarna, it performs fast simultaneous
folding and alignment based on two RNA sequences (or alignments). In
addition to the filtering of considered base pairs by their
probabilities, it filters by conditional probabilities of bases and
base pairs in their enclosing loops.

.PP
The usage, input, constraints-specifications and output are analogous
to locarna; please refer to the help or man page of locarna for
explanations and examples.
