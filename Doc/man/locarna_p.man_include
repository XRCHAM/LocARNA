[>DESCRIPTION]

locarna_p computes sequence and structure match probabilities from
partition functions of locarna pairwise alignments, i.e. from fast
simultaneous folding and alignment based on two RNA sequences (or
alignments).

.SS Input and Constraints

.PP
Please see the documentation of locarna for inputs and the possible
constraints specifications. 

.SS Output

.PP

Probabilities of base and base pair matches can be written to
files. (The total partition function is reported to standard out.)

[DISCLAIMER]

locarna_p is a low level tool; most often this tool is used
indirectly, by calling mlocarna with --probabilistic.  Note that the
performance of locarna_p (as well as basically all tools in the
LocARNA package) is often significantly improved by the use of
suitable application-specific options, deviating from the default
settings.

[EXAMPLES]

Please see the documentation of locarna for call and input constraint
examples.
